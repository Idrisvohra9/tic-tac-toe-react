### TL;DR
The `Game` class is a React component that represents a tic-tac-toe game. It renders a `Board` component and handles the game logic, such as keeping track of the game history, determining the winner, and allowing players to make moves.

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Render the Game component
ReactDOM.render(<Game />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Full Explanation
The `Game` class is a React component that represents a tic-tac-toe game. It has a constructor that initializes the state with an array of 9 squares, a step number, and a boolean indicating whether it is X's turn or not.

The `handleClick` method is called when a square is clicked. It checks if there is a winner or if the square is already filled, and returns early if either condition is true. Otherwise, it updates the square with the current player's symbol (X or O) and updates the state with the new history, step number, and player turn.

The `jumpTo` method is called when a move button is clicked. It updates the state with the selected step number and determines the player turn based on whether the step number is even or odd.

The `render` method renders the game board, status, and move buttons. It first calculates the winner based on the current squares. Then, it maps over the history array to create a list of move buttons. Each button has an `onClick` event handler that calls the `jumpTo` method with the corresponding move number. The status is set to display the winner if there is one, or the next player's turn if there is no winner. Finally, it renders the `Board` component with the current squares and the `handleClick` method as props.

Overall, the `Game` component handles the game logic and renders the game board, status, and move buttons. It uses the `Board` component to render the individual squares.
